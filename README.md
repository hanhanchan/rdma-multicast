# One-sided RDMA Multicast

This repository holds the Tofino prototype implementation to perform one-sided RDMA multicast, proposed in the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3493425.3502766), `Towards a Framework for One-sided RDMA Multicast` accepted at the EuroP4'21 Workshop and published at ANCS'21.

## Usage

Please find the P4 implementation `p4/rdma_icrc`.

You may need to tweak the helper scripts and environment setup w.r.t. to your environment.

Under `src/`, the client-server program can be modified to generated one-sided RDMA Write requests.
